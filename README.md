# Front-End Developer Interview
## Overview
Welcome to the Front-End Developer interview project! This project is designed to evaluate your skills in React development and UX/UI design. You will be tasked with modifying a simple application that includes form submission, data display in a table, and professional styling.

## Project Requirements
### Styling:
- Use Tailwind CSS provided in the project or any other styling method to ensure a cohesive and professional appearance across components.

### Form Component:
- Modify the existing form to include a phone field.

### Table Component:
- Modify the existing table to support the newly added phone field.

### Bonus:
